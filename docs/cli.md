# NInfer CLI

`build/apps/ninfer` runs one request against one registered `.ninfer` artifact. Build NInfer and
download an artifact using the [project README](../README.md) before following this guide.

## Text input

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Summarize the difference between prefill and decode." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 256
```

Exactly one of `--prompt` and `--messages` is required.

Answer content is streamed to stdout. Reasoning, model loading (including the registered target and
canonical `weights_id`), timings, throughput, GPU memory, and speculative-decoding statistics are
written to stderr, so stdout can be redirected independently:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Return one sentence." --max-new 64 \
  > answer.txt 2> run.log
```

Thinking is enabled by default. If the chat template embedded in the loaded artifact exposes
reasoning effort, `--reasoning-effort low|medium|xhigh` selects it; omitting the option uses the
template's default. An artifact whose template does not expose effort rejects the option. Add
`--no-thinking` for direct-response prompt rendering; it cannot be combined with
`--reasoning-effort`. `--greedy` selects exact argmax decoding independently.

## Startup memory profile

GPU residency is frozen when the Engine starts:

- no `--spec` omits MTP/DFlash weights and state and the optimized proposal head;
- `--spec mtp` loads only MTP, while `--spec dflash` loads only the 35B-A3B text-only DFlash
  backend;
- a speculative backend with the full proposal head omits the optimized proposal head;
- Vision is disabled by default, omitting its weights, Vision scratch phase, and frozen
  request-transient allocation;
- `--vision` loads those allocations and enables image/video input.

The complete `.ninfer` inventory is still validated. These choices are not lazy loading: a
text-only Engine rejects media and cannot enable Vision later. DFlash and Vision are mutually
exclusive. The default speculative and Vision settings produce the smallest resident profile.

## Structured messages

`--messages` accepts either a non-empty JSON message array or an object containing `messages`
and an optional `tools` array.

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Answer concisely."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "image": "examples/cli/media/visual_chart.png"
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Describe the chart."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Run message files from the repository root when they contain repository-relative media paths:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --messages examples/cli/messages/image_chart.json \
  --max-context 8192 \
  --max-new 128 \
  --vision
```

Supported roles are `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool`. Message content
may be a string or an ordered array containing:

| Content type | Source field | Accepted source |
|---|---|---|
| text | `text` | string |
| image / image_url | `image` or `image_url` | local path, HTTP(S) URL, or base64 data URI |
| video / video_url | `video` or `video_url` | local path, HTTP(S) URL, or base64 data URI |

`image_url` and `video_url` may be strings or objects containing a string `url`. Assistant
history may include `reasoning_content` and `tool_calls`; a tool result uses role `tool` and
`tool_call_id`.

See [`examples/cli/`](../examples/cli/) for committed text, image, video, mixed-media, thinking,
long-decode, and long-context inputs.

## Speculative decoding

Speculative decoding is disabled by default. Select MTP with one to five draft positions, or the
35B-A3B text-only DFlash backend with one to fifteen. `--lm-head-draft` selects the optimized
proposal head and requires a selected backend:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Write a short explanation of speculative decoding." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 512 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For DFlash:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  --prompt "Write a short explanation of speculative decoding." \
  --max-context 16384 --max-new 512 \
  --spec dflash --draft-tokens 7 --lm-head-draft
```

MTP and DFlash cannot be enabled together. The published [performance results](performance.md)
use MTP with three draft tokens and DFlash with seven draft tokens (block length eight), both with
the optimized proposal head. DFlash accepts up to fifteen draft tokens; seven is the current
measured recommendation rather than a semantic limit.

## Common options

| Option | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `--max-context N` | per-sequence logical context ceiling | `2048` |
| `--kv-capacity N\|auto` | explicit shared Main Text KV capacity, or maximize it from remaining GPU memory; omitted means `--max-context` | `2048` |
| `--prefill-chunk N` | positive text-prefill chunk, in multiples of 128 | `1024` |
| `--max-new N` | requested output-token limit | `128` |
| `--device N` | CUDA device index | `0` |
| `--kv-dtype bf16\|int8\|rk8v4\|rk4v4\|rk4v4-e8\|rk2v4-e8` | KV-cache storage; rotated and E8-lattice modes trade key/value precision for capacity | `bf16` |
| `--spec mtp\|dflash` | speculative backend | off |
| `--draft-tokens N` | MTP `1..5`; DFlash `1..15` | unset |
| `--lm-head-draft` | optimized proposal head | off |
| `--vision` | enable image/video input and load Vision GPU allocations | off |
| `--no-cuda-graph` | disable CUDA Graph decode | graphs on |
| `--no-thinking` | disable thinking in prompt rendering | thinking on |
| `--reasoning-effort low\|medium\|xhigh` | select an effort exposed by the loaded chat template | template default |
| `--greedy` | exact argmax decoding | off |
| `--temperature F` | sampling temperature override | registered model/mode default |
| `--top-p F` | nucleus-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--top-k N` | top-k-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--min-p F` | min-p-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--presence-penalty F` | presence-penalty override | registered model/mode default |
| `--frequency-penalty F` | frequency-penalty override | registered model/mode default (`0`) |
| `--seed N` | sampling seed | `0` |

When a sampling flag is omitted, Engine selects the official general-task preset registered for
the loaded model and the rendered prompt mode. The current presets are:

| Model | Prompt mode | Temperature | Top-p | Top-k | Min-p | Presence penalty |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-27B | thinking | `1.0` | `0.95` | `20` | `0` | `0` |
| Qwen3.6-27B | non-thinking | `0.7` | `0.80` | `20` | `0` | `1.5` |
| Qwen3.8-27B | thinking | `1.0` | `0.95` | `20` | `0` | `0` |
| Qwen3.8-27B | non-thinking | `0.7` | `0.80` | `20` | `0` | `1.5` |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | thinking | `1.0` | `0.95` | `20` | `0` | `1.5` |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | non-thinking | `0.7` | `0.80` | `20` | `0` | `1.5` |

Frequency penalty is `0` in every registered preset. Qwen's separate precise-coding recommendation
is task-specific and is therefore an explicit override rather than an inferred Engine default.

Repeat `--stop-token-id`, `--stop`, or `--reasoning-stop` to add stop conditions. Use
`--raw-output` to expose the frontend's raw output stream and `--print-token-ids` to include
generated token IDs in diagnostics.

Run `./build/apps/ninfer --help` for the exact option contract.

## Context and memory

The registered model IDs have a native context limit of 262,144 tokens. The practical
allocation on one RTX 4090 depends on the selected artifact, media workload, output budget, and
KV-cache type.
Use `--kv-dtype int8` for the maximum-precision profile. The compressed modes store
Hadamard-rotated keys and 4-bit values:

- `rk8v4` keeps 8-bit keys.
- `rk4v4` packs keys to 4 bits.
- `rk4v4-e8` selects 4-bit key codes on the E8 Conway-Sloane lattice. This is the
  recommended long-context mode on the RTX 4090 and fits the full native 262,144
  context. The measured quality gates are in [the fork comparison](udp-fork-comparison.md).
- `rk2v4-e8` packs keys to 2 bits with a 240-root E8 codebook, for maximum capacity.

None of these modes is byte-equivalent to INT8. At depth, `rk4v4-e8` measured no loss in
MTP acceptance or retrieval. The prepared prompt must fit
`--max-context`; generation stops at the remaining context capacity when necessary.
`--kv-capacity N` controls the shared physical Main Text KV pool independently and is rounded up to
the 64-token page size. `--kv-capacity auto` loads the selected weights, measures the remaining GPU
memory, and directly chooses the largest legal page capacity for the complete enabled runtime
layout. This includes the selected speculative backend, fixed sequence state, workspace, Vision
request transient, and CUDA Graph allowance, while leaving the default 1 GiB automatic headroom
unallocated. It does not probe allocations or resize the pool at request time. The single-request
CLI normally leaves the option omitted so it follows
`--max-context`; the distinction matters primarily to a concurrent Engine or server.

At Engine startup NInfer reserves model weights, persistent sequence state, one phase-reused
Program scratch arena, the maximum Vision request-transient buffer when Vision is enabled, and a
separate CUDA Graph driver allowance. Scratch is the maximum of the enabled Text, MTP, DFlash, and
Vision phases, not their sum. Its prefill bound uses
`min(--prefill-chunk,--max-context)`. The request-transient buffer is also frozen at startup; a
media request activates only the needed prefix and performs no project-owned device allocation or
growth.

All weight, sequence, workspace, request-transient, and graph allocations are released when the
Engine is destroyed.

## Aggregate Vision budgets

`--vision-max-attention-pairs N` (default 134217728) and `--vision-max-media-items N` (default 16) bound preprocessing work across the complete image/video history. For screenshot-heavy sessions, `--vision-max-attention-pairs 4294967296 --vision-max-media-items 128` raises these limits. The independent raw-patch and request-body memory limits still apply; this does not reserve more Vision GPU workspace or guarantee that 128 high-resolution images fit. Keep limits fixed for a running service so old media geometry stays stable. Token-count endpoints enforce the same limits.

The raw-patch cap is 262,144 (at most 1.5 GiB of retained FP32 patch features per request). Account for concurrent preprocessors, decoded media and host KV caches when increasing the aggregate work budget.

## YaRN context extension

Qwen3.8-27B supports optional static YaRN through `--rope-yarn-factor F` (1 to 4, default 1) and `--rope-original-max-position 262144`. Factor 1 uses the unchanged native RoPE path. The reference window is 262,144 even though this fork has a larger compiled attention-address envelope. With YaRN enabled, `--max-context` must not exceed `262144 * F`; a 1.5x profile uses `--max-context 393216`. Size `--kv-capacity` separately for all active and retained sessions.

The implementation follows Qwen's published `rope_parameters` and Hugging Face Transformers YaRN: theta 10,000,000, rotary dimension 64 of a 256-dimensional head, beta_fast 32, beta_slow 1, floor/ceil frequency-ramp boundaries, and cos/sin amplitude `1 + 0.1 * ln(F)`. Main Text, MTP and three-axis MRoPE use the same immutable, per-Program coefficients. The Vision tower's independent 2-D RoPE stays native. No model conversion or weight download is needed.

Coefficients are CUDA launch/graph values rather than process-global mutable device symbols. Saved slots and host-cache manifests bind to the YaRN algorithm version, factor and original window: snapshots made under native RoPE or another factor must not be restored into a scaled Engine. Reuse the original full conversation to rebuild its state after changing the factor.

This option is currently restricted to registered Qwen3.8-27B artifacts. Static YaRN may change short-context output; successful memory allocation is not evidence of long-context quality. Test the intended retrieval, vision and generation workload before relying on the extended window.

The latter informed the integration review; this implementation keeps coefficients owned by each Program rather than installing global CUDA tables.
