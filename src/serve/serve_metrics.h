// Cumulative counters behind GET /metrics, in the flat `name value` subset of
// the Prometheus text format.
//
// The four llamacpp:-prefixed counters reproduce llama.cpp's --metrics
// semantics - computed prefill tokens (prefix-cache hits excluded) billed
// against prefill unit time, committed decode tokens against decode unit
// time - so scrapers that difference llama.cpp counters read this server
// without changes. They are sourced from the Engine's live per-unit totals,
// so they advance during a request like llama.cpp's do, not only at its
// completion. The ninfer:-prefixed series report what llama.cpp cannot:
// speculative draft/acceptance totals and prefix-cache reuse.
